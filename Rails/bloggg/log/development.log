I did not succeed in getting a glimpse of the common, for even Horsell and Chobham church towers were in the hands of the military authorities.  The soldiers I addressed didn't know anything; the officers were mysterious as well as busy.  I found people in the town quite secure again in the presence of the military, and I heard for the first time from Marshall, the tobacconist, that his son was among the dead on the common.  The soldiers had made the people on the outskirts of Horsell lock up and leave their houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have said, the day was extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself I took a cold bath in the afternoon.  About half past four I went up to the railway station to get an evening paper, for the morning papers had contained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent, Henderson, Ogilvy, and the others.  But there was little I didn't know.  The Martians did not show an inch of themselves.  They seemed busy in their pit, and there was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous streamer of smoke.  Apparently they were busy getting ready for a struggle.  \"Fresh attempts have been made to signal, but without success,\" was the stereotyped formula of the papers.  A sapper told me it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole.  The Martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the lowing of a cow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I must confess the sight of all this armament, all this preparation, greatly excited me.  My imagination became belligerent, and defeated the invaders in a dozen striking ways; something of my schoolboy dreams of battle and heroism came back.  It hardly seemed a fair fight to me at that time.  They seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About three o'clock there began the thud of a gun at measured intervals from Chertsey or Addlestone.  I learned that the smouldering pine wood into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled, in the hope of destroying that object before it opened.  It was only about five, however, that a field gun reached Chobham for use against the first body of Martians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About six in the evening, as I sat at tea with my wife in the summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon us, I heard a muffled detonation from the common, and immediately after a gust of firing.  Close on the heels of that came a violent rattling crash, quite close to us, that shook the ground; and, starting out upon the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about the Oriental College burst into smoky red flame, and the tower of the little church beside it slide down into ruin.  The pinnacle of the mosque had vanished, and the roof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been at work upon it.  One of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it, flew, and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap of broken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study window.</p>"}, "commit"=>"Create Blog post"}

The soldiers had made the people on the outskirts of Horsell lock up and leave their houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have said, the day was extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself I took a cold bath in the afternoon.  About half past four I went up to the railway station to get an evening paper, for the morning papers had contained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent, Henderson, Ogilvy, and the others.  But there was little I didn't know.  The Martians did not show an inch of themselves.  They seemed busy in their pit, and there was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous streamer of smoke.  Apparently they were busy getting ready for a struggle.  \"Fresh attempts have been made to signal, but without success,\" was the stereotyped formula of the papers.  A sapper told me it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole.  The Martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the lowing of a cow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I must confess the sight of all this armament, all this preparation, greatly excited me.  My imagination became belligerent, and defeated the invaders in a dozen striking ways; something of my schoolboy dreams of battle and heroism came back.  It hardly seemed a fair fight to me at that time.  They seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About three o'clock there began the thud of a gun at measured intervals from Chertsey or Addlestone.  I learned that the smouldering pine wood into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled, in the hope of destroying that object before it opened.  It was only about five, however, that a field gun reached Chobham for use against the first body of Martians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About six in the evening, as I sat at tea with my wife in the summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon us, I heard a muffled detonation from the common, and immediately after a gust of firing.  Close on the heels of that came a violent rattling crash, quite close to us, that shook the ground; and, starting out upon the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about the Oriental College burst into smoky red flame, and the tower of the little church beside it slide down into ruin.  The pinnacle of the mosque had vanished, and the roof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been at work upon it.  One of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it, flew, and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap of broken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study window.</p>"], ["created_at", "2015-05-13 14:03:55.919644"], ["updated_at", "2015-05-13 14:03:55.919644"]]
